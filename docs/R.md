The Data in the Program/System / Data Structures, Define and Organizw/Structure the Data in thge Program /  the Data the Program operates upon:

    Scalar:
        int
        float
        complex number
        string
        date
    
    Data Structures:
        Sequence/Range
        Tuple
        Enumeration
        List (also a surogate Array)
        Dictionary (HashMap)
        Set
        Queue (several implementations, including List)
        Stack (same as above)
        Class
        Array (Numpy)
        DataFrame (Pandas), this is essentially a RDBMS Table abstraction
        TimeSeries (Pandas and several more)

Algorithms:

    Operate on the above Data - Scalar and Data Structure 

Program/System Organization / Architecture / Modular Structure:

    Modules/Components:
        Algorithms and Data Structures
        Functions
        Classes (and class hierarchies)
        Modules
        Packages
    Functional Responsibilities of Modules/Components
    Intefaces between Modules/Components

Parallel Programming:

    MultiThreding
    MultiProcessing
    AsyncIO
    
Decorators:

    Useful for Plugins for Framewrk Extensions

Other:

    Yeild, Generators
    With
    List/Dict Comprehension
    Exceptions
    Runtime instrumentation
    Json and Request
