HOW TO THINK AND GO ABOUT PROGRAM DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING AND THE OVERALL PROJECT ENVIRONMENT AROUND THAT 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Data in the Program/System / Data Structures, Define and Organizw/Structure the Data in thge Program /  the Data the Program operates upon:

    Scalar:

        int
        float
        complex number
        string
        date
    
    Data Structures:

        Sequence/Range
        Tuple
        Enumeration
        List (also a surogate Array)
        Dictionary (HashMap)
        Set
        Queue (several implementations, including List)
        Stack (same as above)
        Class
        Array (Numpy)
        DataFrame (Pandas), this is essentially a RDBMS Table abstraction
        TimeSeries (Pandas and several more)

        Nested Varianrs of all of the above

Algorithms:

    Operate on the above Data - Scalar and Data Structure 

Program/System Organization / Architecture / Modular Structure:

    Modules/Components:
        Algorithms and Data Structures
        Functions
        Classes (and class hierarchies)
        Modules
        Packages
    Functional Responsibilities of Modules/Components - allocate/design
    Intefaces between Modules/Components and Interactions between modules (flow of control and data)

    Name Sapces, VAriable Scope and Module Loading Order in Python

Error Handling / Reliability Design:

    Error conditions/logic, error codes, exceptions
    Logging
    Program Input/Output

Python Bytecode and Virtual Machine:

    Internals
    Stnadrd Lib Debuging, Profiling and Garbage COllection control
    Reflection

Parallel Programming:

    MultiThreding
    MultiProcessing
    AsyncIO
    
Decorators:

    Useful for Plugins for Framework Extensions

Useful Standard/Built-In Functions:

    sorted
    len
    filter
    type
    etc

Other Language Features:

    Yeild, Generators
    With
    List/Dict Comprehension
    Exceptions
    Logging
    Program Input Param parsing
    Runtime instrumentation
    Json and Request
    FileIO
    NetworkIO
    
    Math Operations, Equations and Algos - Math and Qunat Operators and Libs 

Ecosystem of useful third-party Frameworks/Platforms/Libs:

    PySpark
    FastAPI
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Data Visualization
    ML - Keras etc
    etc

Project Related:

    Testing - Manual Tetsing with Debugger and Logging, Automated Unit Testing (Python SPecific), System Integration Testing, Code Coverage (%)
    Lint - coding style standards
    Environments (Dev, UAT, Prod) and Deployment to different environments
    Instrumentation and Ongoing Monitoring
    Testing - Funcional, Scalability, Reliability
    Dev Workflow - code repositories, PRs, repo branching structure etc, CD/CI Pipelines - their organization and structure and how to participate in them
    Project Management and Documentation - Confluence, JIRas, Backlogs, etc
